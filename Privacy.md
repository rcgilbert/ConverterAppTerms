Privacy Policy for Converter App

Last Updated: 2023-12-25

1. Introduction

Welcome to the Converter App. This privacy policy ("Policy") is designed to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for those who use our Converter App ("App") developed for iOS platforms.

2. Information Collection and Use

While the Converter App itself does not collect, store, or process any personal information directly, it utilizes iCloud CloudKit for syncing data between devices. This functionality is designed to enhance user experience by enabling the synchronization of user-specific conversion data across multiple Apple devices owned by the same user.

3. iCloud CloudKit

Data Syncing: When you use our App, your conversion data may be synced across your devices using iCloud CloudKit.
Data Storage: The data stored on iCloud CloudKit is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy and is not accessible by the Converter App developers.
User Consent: By using the iCloud syncing feature, you consent to the transfer of your conversion data to iCloud CloudKit as per Apple’s standard procedures and policies.
Opt-Out Option: Users have the option to opt-out of iCloud syncing by disabling it in their device settings.
4. Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. The App itself does not collect or store any personal information beyond what is required for iCloud CloudKit syncing, thus minimizing the risk of data breaches.

5. Third-Party Services

Apart from iCloud CloudKit used for syncing purposes, the Converter App does not rely on other third-party services that may collect information from users. Therefore, there is no sharing, transferring, or processing of personal data with any other third parties.

6. Children’s Privacy

Our App does not directly collect any personal information, making it suitable for all age groups, including children. However, parental supervision is advised for children under 13, especially regarding the use of iCloud CloudKit for data syncing.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
